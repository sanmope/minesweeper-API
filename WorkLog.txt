WorkLog:

After some time designing and researching on how to implement this RESTFull API for the mine Sweeper, I've decided to implement it with spring-boot framework to reduce overall development time and increase efficiency by having a default setup for unit and integration tests.  

DoD:

• [Done] Design and implement a documented RESTful API for the game (think of a mobile app for your API)
        * spring-boot-starter-web
• [Done] Implement an API client library for the API designed above. Ideally, in a different language, of your preference, to the one used for the API
        * https://editor.swagger.io/
*• [Done] Busyness logic:
*       • [Done] When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will *                be revealed (and repeat)
*       • [Done] Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag
*       • [Done] Detect when game is over
*       • [Done] Time tracking
*       • [Done] Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones
*       • [Done] Ability to select the game parameters: number of rows, columns, and mines
*       • [Done] Ability to support multiple users/accounts
*• [Done] Persistence
*       * AWS: RDS: Postgresql.
*• [Done] Testing
*• [Done] Logging
*       * lombok.extern.log4j.Log4j2;
