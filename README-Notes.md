After some time designing and researching on how to implement this RESTFull API for the mine Sweeper, I've decided to implement it with spring-boot framework to reduce overall development time and increase efficiency by having a default setup for unit and integration tests.  

Requirements and dependencies choosen:

    *RESTful API for the game
        spring-boot-starter-web
    *Persistence
        postgresql
    *Ability to support multiple users/accounts
        spring-boot-starter-security
    *Document API
|       springfox-boot-starter    


Modeling:
    I will create a class that is the Cell for the grid that will contain several properties:
        if it has a mine inside,
        how many cells arround with mines,
        if a red flag is up,
        and a question mark.
    
    a Grid with the following properties:
        columns,
        rows,
        mines


lombok anotations:
    @AllArgsConstructor generates a constructor with 1 parameter for each field in your class. Fields marked with @NonNull result in null checks on those parameters.
    @NoArgsConstructor will generate a constructor with no parameters.
    @Builder lets you automatically produce the code required to have your class be      instantiable with code such as:
        Person.builder().name("Adam Savage").city("San Francisco").job("Mythbusters").job("Unchained Reaction").build();

Adding ModelMapper:When the map method is called, the source and destination types are analyzed to determine which properties implicitly match according to a matching strategy and other configuration. Data is then mapped according to these matches.


Adding Optional: Optional is intended to provide a limited mechanism for library method return types where there needed to be a clear way to represent â€œno result," and using null for such was overwhelmingly likely to cause errors.

Annotation  indicating a method parameter should be bound to the body of the web request. The body of the request is passed through an HttpMessageConverter to resolve the method argument depending on the content type of the request. Optionally, automatic validation can be applied by annotating the argument with @Valid.
