After some time designing and researching on how to implement this RESTFull API for the mine Sweeper, I've decided to implement it with spring-boot framework to reduce overall development time and increase efficiency by having a default setup for unit and integration tests.  

Requirements and dependencies choosen:

    *RESTful API for the game
        spring-boot-starter-web
    *Persistence
        postgresql
    *Ability to support multiple users/accounts
        spring-boot-starter-security
